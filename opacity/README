 Description
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the programs to calculate the opacity of a given
molecule, as a function of wavelength, pressure and temperature.
Opacity calculaiton is based on HITRAN2012 spectral data, which you need
to obtain by yourself. 

The data matrix is saved as a netCDF file.


------------------------------------------------
 Note
------------------------------------------------

- The line broadening profile is assumed to be Voigt profile. 

- (05.29.2016) Calculating 10000 wavenumber grids takes about 185 sec with 2.6
  GHz CPU clock rate. The computation time grows linearly with the number of 
  the grid for pressure and temperature. Thus, for example, making a table
  with 10000 wavenumber grids as well as 31 grids both for pressure and temperature 
  will take ~2 days. 

- The data type of the cross section is 'float64'. Thus, for example, the size
  of the cross section table with 10000 wavenumber grids as well as 31 grids
  both for pressure and temperature are ~76 MB.

 Instruction
------------------------------------------------

(1) Create a data directory under this file.
    For example: 
    	mkdir hitran2012


(2) Obtain HITRAN datasets and save them into the directory. 

    https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/


(3) Create a directory into which you put cross section tables
    For example:
    	mkdir ../xstbl


(4) Modify the parameters in setup_makexstbl.py


(5) Execute!

	python main_makexstbl.py
